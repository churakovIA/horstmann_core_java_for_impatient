/**
 * In this exercise, you will try out what happens when a method is added to an
 * interface. In Java 7, implement a class DigitSequence that implements
 * Iterator<Integer>, not IntSequence. Provide methods hasNext, next,
 * and a do-nothing remove. Write a program that prints the elements of an instance.
 * In Java 8, the Iterator class gained another method, forEachRemaining.
 * Does your code still compile when you switch to Java 8? If you put your Java 7 class
 * in a JAR file and donâ€™t recompile, does it work in Java 8? What if you call the
 * forEachRemaining method? Also, the remove method has become a default
 * method in Java 8, throwing an UnsupportedOperationException. What
 * happens when remove is called on an instance of your class?
